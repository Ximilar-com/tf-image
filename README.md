# tf-image

__tf-image__ implements methods for image augmentation for Tensorflow 2.+ / tf.data.Dataset.  

__Why?__

Official TensorFlow 2+ [tf.image](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image) package contains just a few and simple operations for image augmentation. This is not enought if you want to develop accurate/state of the art models. There is also [tf-addons](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons) projects which contains more of the operations however it is still not enough and requires proper CUDA/CUDNN version.

## Installation

__tf-image__ is not available on PyPi right now. Once it will be available try this:
